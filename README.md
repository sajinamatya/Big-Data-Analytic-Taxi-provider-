# Big-Data-Analytic-Taxi-provider-
leverages ETL processes and data warehousing to manage and analyze large-scale taxi trip datasets.

# Data Overview 
Taxi services produce massive amounts of data every day, such as geospatial locations, fare information, payment methods, and more. Yet, in its raw form, this data holds limited value without proper storage, processing, and analysis. Our project addresses this by applying these techniques to the Taxi Trip Datasetâ€”a real-world collection containing 2,548,358 records.

# Tools and Technology
### Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
### Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data integration
### SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for data analysis
### PySpark- Distributed data storage and processing technologies
### Machine learning algorithms
### Power BI for data visualization
