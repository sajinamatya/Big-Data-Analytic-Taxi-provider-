# Data Overview 
Taxi services produce massive amounts of data every day, such as geospatial locations, fare information, payment methods, and more. Yet, in its raw form, this data holds limited value without proper storage, processing, and analysis. Our project addresses this by applying these techniques to the Taxi Trip Datasetâ€”a real-world collection containing 2,548,358 records.

# Tools and Technology

# Business use case 
A transportation company named TaxiProvider runs a digital platform enabling riders to schedule taxi services for their travel needs. The organization spans multiple urban areas and works with freelance taxi operators to handle ride bookings. Looking to scale their business operations, the company plans to analyze their collected data for actionable insights. This requires building a comprehensive data warehouse solution to support decision-making across their finance, operations, and marketing teams.
