# Data Overview 
Taxi services produce massive amounts of data every day, such as geospatial locations, fare information, payment methods, and more. Yet, in its raw form, this data holds limited value without proper storage, processing, and analysis. Our project addresses this by applying these techniques to the Taxi Trip Datasetâ€”a real-world collection containing 2,548,358 records.
